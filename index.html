        <h1>Evan Gibson</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a highly motivated software engineer with two year of industry experience and a BS degree from 
            DePaul University Chicago. I have always been interested in software engineering and gameplay 
            programming. Over the past few years, I have developed with and have immersed myself in languages 
            used to develop games such as C/C++, C#, Python, and Java and have worked with game engines such as 
            Unreal Engine 4 and Unity. I am not only interested in developing games but am also interested in 
            developing other applications.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Gameplay Programmer - Funcom</h3>
                February 2022 - July 2023
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As a gameplay programmer for Funcom, NC, I developed various features and systems of Conan Exiles. 
                        I resolved issues with existing features and worked with others to develop new features like the clan 
                        emblems feature.

                <h3>Software Engineer Intern - Electronic Arts</h3>
                June 2020 - December 2020
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As a software engineer intern for the Industrial Toys studio, I worked on tools to help 
                        development on Android devices. I also worked on integrating Android APIs into the Unreal 
                        Engine 4 for use in the project.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>OpenGL Game Engine, Game Engine Development 1 and 2 - C++</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For the game engine development classes at DePaul, I wrote a game engine with an OpenGL 
                        renderer. The game engine can render lit and textured objects, process collisions, load and save 
                        scenes, process input, and manage in game events. There is also an edit mode to place game 
                        objects in a scene and visualize collisions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Memory System, Optimized C++ - C++</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the Optimized C++ class at DePaul, I wrote a memory system with malloc and free functions 
                        that out preform std::malloc and std::free significantly. By completing this project, I learned 
                        many useful C++ techniques such as how to align data for efficient use of memory and how to 
                        organize data for optimal access with pointers to maximize cache hits and minimize cache 
                        misses.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Multithreaded Audio Engine, Real Time Multithreaded Architecture - C++</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the Real-Time Multi-Threaded Architecture course at DePaul, I wrote a multithreaded audio 
                        engine using Microsoft’s XAudio2 API with asynchronous load, start, stop, pan, volume, playlist, 
                        and timer functions. By completing this project, I learned how to effectively manage threads and 
                        use mutexes to make data thread safe.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Modified Eight Puzzle Solver, Artificial Intelligence 1 - C++</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the Artificial Intelligence 1 course at DePaul, I developed an Eight Puzzle solver by applying 
                        different search algorithms I learned during the quarter. The application uses and compares the 
                        strengths and weaknesses of the breadth first search, depth first search, depth first search with 
                        iterative deepening and A* search algorithms. Form this project I learned the benefits and draw 
                        backs of different search algorithms.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>UDP-Networked Game, Real-Time Networking - C#</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the Real-Time Networking course at DePaul, I added UDP networking to a game with local 
                        multiplayer to enable networked multiplayer. I developed a system to send and receive optimally 
                        sized packets via UDP, and to mitigate the effects of latency and packet loss.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>SIMD-Optimized Vector/Matrix Math Library, Optimized C++ - C++</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Using Intel’s MMX and SSE intrinsic instructions I significantly improved performance of a vector 
                        and matrix library.
                    </li>

        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p>
            I am really interested in software engineering and game development, but I also enjoy other things. I 
            love dogs and actively dog/house sit for my neighbors for extended periods. I really enjoy photography. I 
            have also been skateboarding for about 15 years.
